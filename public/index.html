  <div class="entry-content"><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FakzMqrPi_dGbGo8LNnhrw.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Designing for Rural India — Part 1</h3><p><em>Journey of designing </em><a href="http://openchs.org/"><em>OpenCHS</em></a><em> with </em><a href="http://samanvayfoundation.org/"><em>Samanvay</em></a></p><p>India does not have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance">National health insurance</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care">universal health care</a> system for all its citizens. This has propelled the private sector to its dominant position in the healthcare market. Private companies provide the lion’s share of healthcare services in the country.</p><p>Despite the structures in place to ensure equality and funding from government and non-government sources, we still observe a visible gap in access to healthcare in rural areas compared to cities. A staggering 68% of the population lives in rural areas and has no or limited access to hospitals and clinics. Consequently, the rural population mostly relies on alternative medicine and government programmes.</p><p>If one had to paint a picture of rural India, it would be people living in mud houses in small villages. These villages have next to no electricity supply. There are setups of solar power stations which people use to charge their cellphones. Travelling to these villages is not always easy. One would require to change at least three different modes of transport to reach many of these villages. The residents seek out healthcare in cases of pregnancy and severe illness like Tuberculosis, Dengue, etc. However, villagers often do not seek treatment for early symptoms which appear less dangerous. This is not always due to lack of awareness. It is often also the case that infrastructure to support the long tail of healthcare is simply not that accessible in rural India.</p><h3>Healthcare in Rural India</h3><p>The public healthcare in rural areas has been developed as a three-tier structure based on predetermined population norms.</p><h4>1. CHC (Community Health Centres)</h4><p>Community Health Centres form the uppermost tier and are established and maintained by the State Government. Community health centres are staffed by four medical professionals supported by twenty-one paramedical and other staff. Surgeons, physicians, gynaecologists and paediatricians provide comprehensive care in each CHC.<br>Each CHC has thirty indoor beds, an Operating Theatre, X-ray, Labour Room, and Laboratory facilities. The community health centre provides expert facilities in obstetric and other care for patients referred to them by the four primary health centres within their jurisdiction.</p><h4>2. PHC (Primary Health Centres)</h4><p>Primary Health Centres (PHCs) comprise the second tier in rural healthcare. PHCs provide integrated, curative and preventive healthcare to the rural population with emphasis on preventive and promotive aspects. Activities include promotion of better health and hygiene practices, tetanus inoculation of pregnant women, intake of IFA tablets and institutional deliveries. A medical officer is in charge of the PHC supported by fourteen paramedical and other staff. Each primary health centre has four to six beds. Patients are referred to the PHCs by six sub-centres.</p><h4>3. Sub-centres</h4><p>A sub-centre is the most peripheral institution and the first contact point between the primary healthcare system and the community. An Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) is in charge of six sub-centres each of which provides basic drugs for minor ailments. A sub-centre provides services in relation to maternal and child health, family welfare, nutrition, immunisation, diarrhoea control, and control of communicable diseases. ANMs also use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.unicef.eanmapp&amp;hl=en">Anmol Tablet</a>, a product that aids in maintaining and collecting data, specific to primary health.</p><h4>4. Non-government Infrastructures</h4><p>Apart from the government bodies there are other players in the system, which are closest to the villagers (bottom most in this tier). There are private hospitals, which run to provide special services or even basic healthcare.</p><p>Accessing health support is not that easy for village residents. They have to travel long distances to visit public hospitals spending money, and time that could be spent doing their daily chores. That’s when community health services come to play.</p><p>There are non-profit NGO Hospitals which run Community Health Services (CHS). They hire and train health workers who work closely with villagers in providing health services and education.</p><p>Health Workers who work as a part of the Community Health Services are known as <strong>VHWs (Village Health Workers)</strong>, as a part of <em>CRHP (Comprehensive Rural Health Programme)</em>. Jamkhed is a programme run under CRHP.</p><p><em>Jamkhed</em> is centered around mobilising and building the capacity of the community, empowering the people to bring about their own improvements in health and poverty-alleviation. This is one of the better known and appreciated community health systems.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PKuZOwMYCS8JO1tm_dap7w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Health Workers with a monthly visit chart on the wall</figcaption></figure><h3>Role of VHW ( Village Health Workers )</h3><p>VHWs are individuals selected by the villagers. They are responsible for providing consultation and prescription on basic health care. Their appointment by the community helps establish villagers’ trust in them.</p><p>VHWs typically take care of a single village, but if required, they can be responsible for up to five villages. They are trained in basic healthcare, understanding symptoms and personality development. Since they are only trained in basic healthcare, they escalate severe cases and recommend the patients to visit hospitals. Quite often these volunteers are women.</p><p>Apart from this, VHWs also bust widely held superstitions by providing elementary health education.</p><p>Health workers use their considerable interpersonal communication skills to bring about important behavioural changes with respect to reproductive and hygiene practices in their rural communities.</p><h3>How do they operate now?</h3><p>The infrastructural support that these health workers get is mostly via Community Health programs and some inventory support from the government.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7RlO_lSMkHgEtYwKt5323g.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zMpx7rxkyVO6pSNU8e8n-w.png" /><figcaption>Inventory procurement list and inventory at the health centers</figcaption></figure><p>Here are some highlights about their daily operations -</p><h4>Use of Paper:</h4><p>The health workers <em>still</em> use paper for most of their work. They are provided with a chart that maps various symptoms to common ailments and relevant medication. While this may enable the health workers to swiftly treat common ailments, the strict mapping unfortunately severely restricts their ability to correctly identify edge cases or more subtle health issues.</p><h4>Inventory List:</h4><p>Procurement of medicines is also done using paper. Health workers also track the need for medicines, availability and expiry dates of the medicines. Medicines are procured from Sub-centres where the health workers visit often to give reports to ANM’s about their respective villages.</p><h4>Patient History</h4><p>The health workers aren’t equipped to look at patients history at the time of consultation. They keep manual records which are too comprehensive to look into at the time of visits.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2B5ceasDOjVx1YHxEuY2eA.png" /><figcaption>Health Worker educating a resident about preventive measures</figcaption></figure><h3>How does OpenCHS help?</h3><p><strong>OpenCHS</strong> strives to fill this gap and provide a decision support system that helps a health worker perform diagnoses. The system also provides the health workers with the steps for treatment.</p><h4>What is OpenCHS?</h4><p>OpenCHS is an Open Community Health Service platform that works in collaboration with NGO Hospitals. OpenCHS is a mobile app that is used by Village Health Workers (VHW) in the field or in their clinics when patients visit them.</p><p>OpenCHS helps VHWs to record patient data, perform diagnoses and manage programme statuses. The app also enables the health workers to consider individual patients’ medical histories during their diagnoses.</p><h3>Our challenges while designing the product</h3><ol><li><strong>Physical Constraints: </strong>Data is not recorded as someone on a desk job would. Health workers not only collect data with the app but they also have to use health equipment to take measurements. This requires the health workers to keep switching their attention between the patient and the application.</li><li><strong>No Electricity and Network Connectivity:</strong> VHWs don’t have access to electricity. They use basic cellphones (not smartphones), which they charge using solar charging stations located at central areas of villages. There is also next to no network connectivity which makes it difficult for an application to work in the field.</li><li><strong>Localisation &amp; Multi-lingual Support</strong>: The application is intended to be used throughout multiple states of India. Each state has their own language. Some villages within a state may even use multiple dialects. We focused on providing multi-lingual support and localisation, in particular with regard to specialised medical terminology and concepts.</li><li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: VHWs live in remote villages of India, where there is very little or no access to technology. They are used to basic cellphones, i.e. no smartphones. We had to be cautious about not having a higher learning curve for the application for them, so they don’t face issues when they are in the field.</li></ol><h3>What did we do?</h3><p>Considering the challenges and constraints that we were working with, this is how we approached the design of the application.</p><h4><strong>It works o</strong>ffline:</h4><p>We were aware that <em>the user is not going to be connected to a network 98% of the time, so we made the app work offline</em>. We store all data locally on the device. The app only connects to a server when synchonising data. Typically health workers visit a sub-centre or another place with internet connectivity monthly. Recorded data is reported to the hospitals as part of the synchronisation.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MZeH0coiPC7ZQ9_UCDR__w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Image 1 — sync status notification | Image 2 — sync finished 50%</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Decision Support</strong>:</h4><p>The application provides decision support based on the recorded data and suggests treatment. We built our algorithm in collaboration with medical practitioners and took into account common health procedures. The algorithm even helps the health worker identify emergencies and provide appropriate medical care. When a patient needs medical attention from a trained medical professional, the application suggests them to inform the patients of the details and visit a hospital.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OmjtGwXuvfp2xf7KsJy7rw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Image 1 — Patient profile and history | Image 2 — Treatment result after consultation</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Localisation and Multi-lingual Support</strong>:</h4><p>The application will be implemented with multi-lingual support. For each implementation, there will be localisation for specialised medical terminology used by the residents of the villages. Currently, we have an implementation in Marathi, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.openchs.org/"><em>here</em></a>.</p><h4><strong>Ease of Use:</strong></h4><p>Ease of use was our major focus while designing this application.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Keep it simple, focused</em></strong>: We tried to understand different activities that a Health Worker performs, and based on those use cases, created focus in the application, instead of going by one interface for all flows, like a dashboard.</li><li><strong><em>Attention on Iconography</em></strong>: We experimented with iconography using various styles and even with contextual icons. This quickly proved infeasible given that our users were stretched through rural India. <br>We followed these simple rules of iconography: <br>-<em> Keep it simple and schematic</em>, i.e. avoid details<br>- <em>5 second rule,</em> if you can’t think of that icon in five seconds then that icon probably is not a good choice<br>- <em>Memorability</em>, making the icons distinct enough that they are remembered even after prolonged usage.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/813/1*hhFllilpRP6Jol7Sm-J-cQ.png" /><figcaption>Few options of icons we considered for patient profile ; we finally picked the last one</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong><em>Understand Behaviour</em></strong>: We tested an alpha version of the application with Health Workers to see if they are comfortable with data entry and understand input fields as concepts. To our surprise, the first thing the health worker did was swipe on the screen. It was most interesting because we knew that our users don’t use smart phones, so how did this come up as a first interaction in this person’s head? Perhaps media has been reaching them through means which one can’t imagine.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ic6AxjbFELdopAfpb3KKfw.png" /><figcaption>Testing of the alpha version with the health worker</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>So, What’s next?</strong></h4><p>The application is yet to be released. The plan is to implement it at one village first and then scale accordingly. <br>We are looking forward to two types of feedback. After the implementation of the application, the health workers will be trained. At this stage will be able to get quick feedback about usability and other challenges.</p><p>The second feedback will have a rather longer loop, where the health workers will be using it in the field and on their return we will learn about how it went and get more qualitative feedback. <a href="http://www.openchs.org/"><em>Here</em></a> is all the documentation, including designs of the project so far.</p><h4>Want to know more?</h4><p>There has been much discussion about each flow and decision, in multiple small and large sessions that we will be sharing in detail shortly so that you can better understand our efforts. Keep on the lookout :)</p><p><em>Thanks to </em><a href="http://nilenso.com"><em>nilenso</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://samanvayfoundation.org/"><em>Samanvay</em></a><em> team for the opportunity to work on this interesting problem.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>*Deliberately sensationalist headline designed to grab eyeballs.</p>


<p>We recently concluded annual reviews at <a href="http://nilenso.com">nilenso</a>, at the end of which, Sandy, who recently joined us, asked: “Why is our process the best we can have?”</p>


<p>This led to a lot of reminiscing about how reviews were conducted at other companies that some of us had worked at.</p>


<p>One example went like this: I ask people to review me. I don’t get to read what they said, or find out if they even bothered to write anything at all. Someone from my team (a senior, usually my boss) would look at all these reports along with HR, and hold a meeting with me. The meeting basically involved my boss giving me a summary of the above, based on his/her understanding/interpretation. While I could ask for explanations and examples when I received feedback that I couldn’t relate to, they were not always forthcoming.</p>


<p>There <em>was</em> in fact a level system based on which variable pay was decided, but this was not disclosed. Since the bonuses were kept confidential, even if a person did find out what someone else made, they couldn’t question their pay relative to their colleague (maybe s/he is a better negotiator?).** There was no incremental movement between levels. Post x number of years, you either moved up or out.</p>


<p>Another colleague said that reviews at his previous organisation involved filling out a report, mentioning the number of bugs you had fixed (or caused), SLAs you had met (or missed), and so on, and that “regardless of all this, your appraisal merely depended on the ‘relationship’ you had developed with your manager. Nothing really came about even when you rejected whatever level the manager gave you, because in the end s/he decides it.”</p>


<p>While these may sound like extreme cases, they are very real (and not all that uncommon). Regardless of experience, the adjectives thrown around to describe the performance management process ranged from “random” and “unfair” to “opaque” and “senseless”.</p>


<p>We’ve <a href="https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2015/06/30/how-to-co-op-salaries-reviews/">written</a> about how we conduct reviews before, but here’s a quick recap.</p>


<ul><li>We use an <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/reviews">app</a> (hey, we’re a tech company!) to write reviews for each other. This is open source, if you’d like to use it, be our guest.</li><li>The reviews written are visible to everyone within nilenso.</li><li>Once this is done (and we stress that reviews should summarise feedback that has <em>already been given during the course of the year)</em> and a “level” has been suggested, we collectively sit down to discuss, and finalise compensation for the coming year.</li></ul>


<p>Stacey Adams’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_theory">equity theory</a>, that describes how individuals perceive the distribution of resources is well documented. In order to apply this concept, however, and to determine whether one’s compensation is fair, what one needs is data on how the available resources (profits) were distributed to begin with. The approach that most organisations take in this regard is to hold back information relevant to employees. We run against that grain here.</p>


<p>I don’t claim that our method is perfect. In fact, it’s constantly being tweaked. I would posit, however, that the fact that the rationale behind it is completely transparent, and open to critique, makes it better than a system which keeps hidden from its participants, the thought that went into creating it.</p>


<p>I’m also not going to pretend that this will work for everyone. More specifically, I’ll admit that this process may not scale well, and beyond a point, will have to be adapted it to suit the needs of a company that employs hundreds, as opposed to tens of people.</p>


<p>In the meantime, I’ll leave you with this quote by JFK:</p>


<blockquote>“We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.”</blockquote>


<p>**We would write down our bonuses on a piece of paper, throw them in a hat, and then read them out loud. This way, everyone knew where s/he stood, but no one knew who got what.</p>

I still can't remember first learning about Pre-Menstrual Symptoms as a child. I don't remember the specific event, but the understanding conveyed. I imagine it went something like this: "My Mom was really grouchy this morning." - "Oh, she probably has PMS." - "Is that a disease?" - "Nah, it's something that happens to Moms once a month. They get really grouchy and you should just leave them alone."</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">My teen years didn't do much to broaden my understanding. It was eventually apparent that menstruation affected all women&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #545454; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small; line-height: 18.2px;">—</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">&nbsp;not just Moms&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #545454; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small; line-height: 18.2px;">—</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">&nbsp;and that the process began just as my own pre-teen body was thrown into fits and starts of its own. I learned the basics of female anatomy from Health class and Sex Ed, but even as a young adult, I mentally associated menstruation with violent and seemingly illogical mood swings. I began to see it as a physiological phenomenon and the cause of complex mental/physical interactions not clearly understood by either those affected or the field of neuroscience. As with so many other subjects, I didn't really learn the&nbsp;</span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 25.6px;">true</em><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">&nbsp;basics of menstruation and female anatomy until I observed them first-hand. Direct experience (or, in this case, as direct experience as is possible for males) always trumps even the deepest theoretical and intellectual understanding.</span></div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">My first girlfriend in college suffered from menstrual cramps. The phrase "suffered from" has watered itself down over the ages to mean "influenced by". While my intention is not to exclude that interpretation, I must be explicit about the distinct imagery I hope to convey: When she had cramps, she&nbsp;<em style="box-sizing: border-box;">suffered</em>. This specific brand of suffering is an intense physical pain that leaves a person clenched in a ball, rolling on the floor, begging for deliverance.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">The first time I saw this my childish ignorance about menstruation was obliterated. This process was genuine, visceral, horrible, and routine. My childish attitude toward the "problem" has taken the intervening decades to correct. As an 18-year-old, I thought my job was to be company and support during these painful episodes. While some women may desire this of their friends and spouses, I've found (in my limited anecdotal experience) that most just want to be left alone until the feeling passes. The experience is physically unpleasant, the discomfort can be embarrassing, and little can be done about the situation but wait for it to resolve itself.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">Which brings us to the workday. If you are a man, or a woman who does not experience menstrual cramps, imagine fighting through a workday (or two) with a searing pain emanating from within the depths of your body. Now imagine that you are acutely aware of the source of pain but it's not a social norm to announce such sorts of things: if you want relief from this, your only option is a generic "sick day", which are doled out in finite number by your employer.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">Now imagine you are presented with this day of torture and this lose-lose decision&nbsp;<em style="box-sizing: border-box;">every month</em>.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">At <a href="http://www.nilenso.com/" target="_blank">nilenso</a> (and everywhere, I hope), the solution is clear. First, destroy any childish taboo or squeamishness about menstruation and menstrual cramps: this is simply a fact of life we must all be comfortable with given the limitations of our human biology. Then, dedicate optional days to this event every month. If someone sends a note in the morning: "I have cramps." the team knows she's unreachable for that day. That's it. No sick days, no fighting through a day of pain at the office, and no unnecessarily burdensome decision.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px; margin-bottom: 16px;">We look forward to a day when this policy is so well understood and so commonplace it need not even be written down. But given that this hasn't even always been an explicit policy at nilenso (and we like to think of ourselves as relatively progressive), we realize there is still much work to be done.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;"><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">Many thanks to the women on our team.

Menstruation is a known quantity: it is common to all pre-menopausal adult women and it occurs 13 times a year. As such, it should be addressed in isolation. To separate menstruation from health issues (migraines, flu, food poisoning, or any of the other issues which cause someone to take leave from work) demands that one's environment avoid conflating the two, implicitly or explicitly. This requires an explicit acceptance of the terms governing the policy.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">Our policy is this: When you have cramps, send an email (or equivalent) notifying the team that "I have cramps." and then take the day off.<br /><br /><br /><b>Isn't this problem solved by unlimited sick leave?</b><br /><br />No, for two reasons. The first reason is straightforward: menstruation is not an illness. As mentioned above, it is a natural and cyclical (therefore, predicable) process.<br /><br />The second reason is somewhat nuanced but worth considering in its own right: policies on Sick Leave are not static. Nilenso's own policy on Sick Leave has changed drastically in recent years and our particular example is precisely why unlimited sick leave doesn't solve the problem in a satisfactory way. Last year, we eliminated unlimited sick leave. We still have unlimited sick leave for disability (say when someone is seriously injured or has Dengue Fever, which has happened) but for various reasons we now track sick days. If our menstruation policy and sick leave policy were conflated, eliminating unlimited sick leave would have had direct consequences on menstruation leave.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><b>How do we get from "taboo" to "normal"?</b></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">We cheated.

Until then, however, we will lean on the #2 Rule in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" target="_blank">Zen of Python</a>:</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;"><b>"Explicit is better than implicit."</b></span><br /><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">There are a number of reasons for this. We do not want the guideline or policy to fall into question and administration of our business changes (nilenso is structured as a representative democracy and the administration is meant to change). Every employee should understand the terms of the agreement, since both a guideline and a policy are an agreement between the organization and its constituent members. An explicit written policy, in plain English, is easier to understand than a guideline.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">Perhaps most importantly (since it is future-facing), a written policy forces changes to the policy to also be made explicitly. For example, it would be a disappointing regression of the policy indeed if we were to begin demanding proof of someone's menstrual cramps... but this has occurred in other corporations in other countries, which means it isn't unheard of. A written policy ensures such regressions (or any other change) is identified as an event in the common legal understanding between the employees of the company. Events future to these changes can then retrospect on the change and how/why it came about.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><b>What about similar policies which have failed?</b></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">There are a number of articles (we won't link any here) which attack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_leave" target="_blank">menstrual leave</a>, citing examples in particular countries and companies across the globe. These policies have not always been successful and the failed installations often seem to be a product of sexism. However, where they have failed, such articles do not propose alternatives. The implicit alternative is to return to the consumption of sick leaves. The argument that menstrual leave exacerbates existing sexism in the workplace is weak, at best. "Existing sexism" is not a baby to be coddled nor a concept to keep safely hidden. There is sexism in every work space and for the infection to be removed it must be dug out. If your workplace or office does not already have frank, open discussions about the state of sexism, bigotry, racism, and zealotry in society, you might use menstrual leave as a conversation piece to get started.</div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, 'segoe ui', arial, freesans, sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol';">Nilenso is far from perfect and our preferences, fears, and prejudices guide us as much as anyone else.

However, none of these conditions is inherent to one's existence as a human being. Each of these illnesses is variously treatable, preventable, and/or curable.

Responding to abuse of any leave policy is orthogonal to the structure of the policy itself. For example, nilenso has a few other distinct leave policies:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="line-height: 25.6px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>National holidays:</u> When we are legally obligated to close the office, everyone should notify their teams and clients.</span></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 25.6px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>Vacation:</u> Leave for vacation is requested of the team and client, with enough lead time to plan around the person's absence.</span></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 25.6px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>(Limited) Sick Leave:</u> Illness is hard to anticipate, so this usually comes as an email to the team that same morning.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><u>(Unlimited) Very Sick Leave:</u> Bangalore is subtropical, giving us both beautiful weather and exposure to very serious diseases.

For those in managerial and administrative positions, conversations about abuse of the leave policy tend to be about excessive liberties taken. Some of these conversations can happen in a group, some are better one-on-one. In the case of a perceived abuse of menstrual leave, a female (for obvious reasons) senior staff member should approach the conversation with a curious and open mind. As before, if the environment is one of mutual trust this conversation shouldn't be difficult.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>What if I want to come to work?</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Of course! It's important that this policy remain <i>optional</i>. Not everyone experiences menstruation the same way. Some women we spoke to prefer to be at home during menstrual cramps. Others prefer to come to the office and work independently in a comfortable space. Some even have support groups who prepare food &amp; tea for anyone who is menstruating and give them a comfortable space while allowing them to be with other people. It is important to figure out what works for your company and for you as an individual.</span></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>I work at a large corporation and I'm skeptical of introducing such a policy. How could we make it work?</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We understand your skepticism. Every organization is different and will require a slightly different approach. Even two organizations of comparable size may face drastically different challenges when implementing a policy like this. We talked about what this policy might look like in a larger organization and came up with three broad points to consider:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 25.6px;"><u>Openness:</u> Not everyone needs to know about everyone else's leave. For something as personal as menstrual leave, every organization will need to consider the audience. Who needs to know? Your boss? Your team? HR? How comfortable are people in your organization with sharing such information, and how broadly?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 25.6px;"><u>Abuse:</u> We've covered this above but it's worth reiterating that we feel the only solution to preventing abuse is to grow trust within the hierarchy of your organization and between individuals.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 25.6px;"><u>Taboo:</u> Work continuously to dissolve the taboo. Only if everyone is well-informed and the conversation is open and honest can a group find the openness required for successful execution of the policy and the trust required to eliminate abuse.</span></li></ol><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In a large company, such a policy is likely to fall under the purview of Human Resources. It will probably contain more words. There may be multiple layers of communication required. None of these complications change the foundation of the policy, however: eliminate the taboo associated with menstruation by talking about it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><b><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Must I announce "I have cramps." explicitly and publicly?</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The short answer is no.</span></span></div><div class="p2"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="s2"></span><br /></span></div><br /><div class="p3"><span class="s2"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">This is the token phrase at nilenso and (all) our leaves are usually announced globally, but it need not work this way. Every organisation (every individual within the organisation) can collectively agree on who the announcement needs to be made to, and with what level of specificity, as long as it's clear and unambiguous. Avoid euphemisms.</span></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div></div>
