You've probably seen awareness campaigns about the dangers of air or water pollution. Nutrition programmes to curb obesity and diabetes. Vaccination camps to ensure that children are properly inoculated against debilitating conditions. How do governments decide where to deploy limited budgets so they have the greatest impact on population health? This is not something we think about often (or at all), but accurate and consistent data on disease and death rates are critical for policy makers to invest their energies and budgets in the most effective manner.

One approach, is to start by collecting _all_ the data. This is how medical doctor and economist Dr. Chris Murray went about the Global Burden of Disease studies with the intent to tabulate the world's illness and mortality. [1]

Product Managers often find themselves in a similar position -- you have to determine the best way to allocate limited resources for maximum impact. And it can be tempting to adopt a similar approach in the quest for the "perfect" data-driven decision -- invest significant effort in instrumenting and collecting _all_ available data, trying to improve the precision of the measurements, and finally setting up dashboards to analyse and visualise what you have. Trying to follow the user journey of each user to “solve” all of their problems, though, is unnecessary. 

Instead, first define what you are trying to do, and then come up with an acceptable metric to measure it. Acknowledge that all metrics are approximations, and that they will fall short (as numbers always do), when they try to represent reality. Also ask yourself if a more precise measurement will really make a _significant difference to outcomes_. If not, move on. You can always revisit the metrics as your product and consumers evolve, but frequent churn with definitions, and parsing of greater and greater quantities of data in more and more complex ways will invariably cost you more than it’s worth.

In the same way, I've seen Product Managers obsess over whether churn was 35% or 36%, when it has no material impact on what you're going to do about it. Consistently applying the same methodology and definitions, and observing trends is a far better way to spend your time.

Similarly, customer support ticket volume tracks the number of support requests or issues reported. General trends and patterns can be valuable, even if individual ticket data isn't completely accurate or comprehensive.

Conversion rates by ad, or media, are another great example of a product metric that is often tracked uncompromisingly, without much to show for it. While the metric itself is important, acknowledging that it is difficult to correlate how much influence a specific ad has in inciting a purchase is equally important. An individual is living their life -- several factors may trigger interest, such as hearing about the product from a friend. In the same vein, a payment flow may be interrupted in different ways, like hearing the doorbell while looking for a credit card. Attempting to ascribe a motive to all of the users decisions is not just impractical, it's wasteful. Decide how good your estimates need to be, and live with them. If you really don't know what to do with the extra time, here's a hint, talk to your users instead.

In each of these cases, striving for accuracy is important. However, actionable insights can often be derived from approximate data, allowing teams to make informed decisions without needing perfect information. Not only does this ensure that you're optimising the dollars spent on instrumentation, storage and analysis, it also trains you to focus on what's important -- impact.

tl;dr Understand that data collection and visualisation are complex, and take effort, time and money. More importantly, recognise when you have "good enough" data, and move to the next step.
