* No good abstraction to talk to an LLM (context creation and manipulation)
* No standardised LLM conversation format
* Inconsistent handling of thinking tokens
* No easy (or performant) way to create reproducible sandboxes/envs for agents
* No good context observability tools
* Poor MCP client and server implementations
* Poor LLM gateway implementations
* No good flexible eval annotation tool that supports stuff like semantic clustering
* Poor library/SDK story outside Python and JS ecosystems
