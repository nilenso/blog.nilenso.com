> “Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless. That is because they are intrinsically systems problems—undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to *restructure* it.”

What can a technologist do to make the world a better place?

My stint in public health taught me that it is approachable for a technologist to massively improve the world—and that adopting a systems thinking lens can help a lot.

We have the skill sets and the tools to scale ideas and methods. This puts us in a position where we do not have to accept a bad thing that we see around us—we can fix it.

Here's a bad thing I saw around me—the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes—around ten million people die every year because of this.

Here's what we can do to fix it—collaborate with all the thankless people in the trenches of public health and enable them to do their job.

Public health is a notoriously hard problem to work on. Before I worked with Resolve To Save Lives, I had almost no clue about what I could do to make any kind of dent in this space. It turns out that it helps to think in systems. Let's strengthen the notion of what I mean by a system.

*System*: A set of elements or parts that is coherently organized and interconnected in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of behaviors, often classified as its “function” or “purpose".

* A system is more than the sum of its parts.
* Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information.
* The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior.
* System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.

The public healthcare system is so fractally complex that one could argue that it would be futile for me to even begin to describe it. Anyway here goes.

This is a program that the non-communicable diseases division of the Health Department of Peculiaristan has come up with.

I've taken a peculiar decision to label the fat arrows as "flows". This is because all systems involve interconnects through which information (or actual people) flows. These flows play an important role in defining a system's purpose (which may or may not match the system's _stated_ purpose!).

We also have a few _stocks_, which you can think of as the memory of the history of changing flows in this system.

To put it together;

**Stock**: The number of registered patients that need to return to care to take their medicines and get their vitals (like blood pressure) checked.  
**Patient Flow**: They go to clinics or hospitals to get their medicines.

**Stock**: Patients appointment data collected when a patient visits. Is their BP controlled? Have they been prescribed and given medication? Did they not show up at all?  
**Patient Data Flow**: This is the flow of the data that has been recorded on the ground into the hands of analysts and program managers who will aggregate these into indicators to drive decisions.



* talk about the flows
* stocks: patient data, patient well-being, willingness to return to care
