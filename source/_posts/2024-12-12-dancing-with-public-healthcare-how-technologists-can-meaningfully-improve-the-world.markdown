> Systems thinking leads to another conclusion, however, waiting, shining, obvious, as soon as we stop being blinded by the illusion of control. It says that there is plenty to do, of a different sort of “doing.” The future can’t be predicted, but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. Systems can’t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned. We can’t surge forward with certainty into a world of no surprises, but we can expect surprises and learn from them...

> “Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless. That is because they are intrinsically systems problems—undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.”

What can a technologist do to make the world a better place?

My stint in public health taught me that it is approachable for a technologist to massively improve the world—and that adopting a systems thinking lens can help a lot.

As technologists we have the skill sets and the tools to scale ideas and methods. This puts us in a position where we do not have to accept a bad thing that we see around us—we can fix it.

Here's a bad thing I saw around me—the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, the biggest cause of heart disease and death.

Here's what we can do to fix it—collaborate with all the thankless people in the trenches of public health and enable them to do their job.

Public health is notoriously hard—before I worked with Resolve To Save Lives, I had almost no clue about what I could do to make any kind of dent in this space. It turns out that it helps to think in systems. Let's strengthen the notion of what I mean by a system.

*System*: A set of elements or parts that is coherently organized and interconnected in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of behaviors, often classified as its “function” or “purpose".
* A system is more than the sum of its parts.
* Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information.
* The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior.
* System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.
