## MCP is solving the problem that most protocols solve

* m x n problem
* AI's m x n problem
* "USB-C for AI"
* How MCP makes an mxn problem into an m+n problem

## What MCP does not solve
* It does not make your AI product smarter
* Giving access to more tools prompts and resources â‰  better product

## Use case: exposing Open Data to AI agents
* How I wrote this
* Brief explanation of the code
* How this MCP theoretically helps
* What writing this MCP does not help with

## Should I build an MCP?
* Reemphasise properties of MCPs
* A lot of usefulness and capabilities exist on the client

## Details about the protocol (should this be in the appendix?)

## References, for a deeper dive
