Model Context Protocols, like nearly all protocols, solve the M ⨯ N integration problem by turning it into an M + N integration problem.

By integrating against the MCP standard, an AI application does not have to figure out how to fetch data or take actions specific to a platform.

MCP may not make your AI smarter, or improve your product, but it will reduce the friction to integrate against other applications that already support MCP.

## MCP is solving the problem that most protocols solve

* m x n problem
* AI's m x n problem
* "USB-C for AI"
* How MCP makes an mxn problem into an m+n problem

## What MCP does not solve
* It does not make your AI product smarter
* Giving access to more tools prompts and resources ≠ better product

## Use case: exposing Open Data to AI agents
* How I wrote this
* Brief explanation of the code
* How this MCP theoretically helps
* What writing this MCP does not help with

## Should I build an MCP?
* Reemphasise properties of MCPs
* A lot of usefulness and capabilities exist on the client
* MCP is a clear concrete thing to do, but it doesn't make a good product. It's another tool in your toolbox.

## Details about the protocol (should this be in the appendix?)
