If you are near the south or west of the subcontinent this college fest season, be sure to sign up for <a href="https://www.devcamp.in/wiki/Register">devcamp Bangalore</a> and <a href="https://barcamp.org/BarCampPune4">Barcamp Pune</a>. Each unconference will run out of the respective ThoughtWorks office, and Sexy MF will be in attendance. If you're coming to Barcamp, let me know!
