A few months ago, I was co-facilitating [a "Birds of a Feather" session](https://hasgeek.com/fifthelephant/2025/sub/birds-of-feather-bof-session-finding-signal-in-a-n-8hrRznGe3qf6e7zXxKwcDi) on keeping up with AI progress.

A big talking point that came up from the ICs and engineering leaders that participated was that popular public benchmarks are insufficient for determining if an AI model is a good fit for their product.
