AI should be adopted by serious engineering teams that want to build thoughtful, well-crafted products. Doing so is predicated on skillful usage of these tools. Our obsession with building high-quality software for over a decade has driven us to figure out how this new way of building can result in better products.

This living playbook is based on our experience working with AI tools in the messy trenches of production software, where no one can afford to get away with vibes. We hope other teams can learn and benefit from our findings.

## Why build with AI?

**Building with AI is fast**. With the right kind of usage, we have indeed seen massive improvements in velocity for shipping new features. The velocity improvements are not evenly spread. In our experience, the smaller straightforward tasks benefit massively more from AI compared to bigger, gnarlier work such as designing a good system. But the speed-up in the smaller ongoing engineering work helps teams allocate more time and focus on harder problems.

This velocity is important, because when harnessed correctly, it allows teams to tighten feedback loops with users faster and make the product better. Any team that does not adopt AI tools effectively will be outcompeted by teams that ship faster using them.

The hype around the velocity has lead to some people and teams hastily adopting and pushing AI tools, and being disappointed by the output and quality. There is a good reason for this. AI tools are sophisticated tools that are frankly, difficult an unintuitive to use. Hold it wrong, and you can at best generate underwhelming results, and at worst slow down your velocity greatly by drowning your project in slop and technical debt. We have seen this play out both ways time after time.
