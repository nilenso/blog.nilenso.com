Transformers are the crucial building block that enabled the creation of LLMs. Though they are neural networks, their architecture has key differences from previous popular neural networks like CNN/RNN/LSTMs. I wanted to understand that architecture, how they are trained and used for prediction.

At this point, I understand how neural networks are structured and how supervised learning is implemented with forward and back propagation. [You can learn that [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)]

As Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet was released today, I decided to use it to learn about transformers. This is the conversation history, by the end of which I had a decent handle on how text transformers work.
