Generative AI has been the fastest moving technology I have seen in my lifetime. It's also one of the most misunderstood technologies with respect to what its capabilities actually are.

Organisations underestimating the capabilities of AI are likely to miss out on its true value and disruption potential. A common example I see most organisations miss out on today is the [speed increase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ3vMx_aJ4) brought in by [AI coding tools](/blog/2025/05/29/ai-assisted-coding/). Organisations that still view AI as mostly nonsensical "stochastic parrots" are likely to be beaten by other organisations that understand and integrate AI effectively.

On the other hand, organisations can overestimate how capable AI is. This often happens due to the undue hype. Some of this comes from the frontier labs, but a lot of it comes from a slew of "influencers" and people who frankly don't know what they are talking about.

We are in one of the most polluted information environments. If you're not being deliberate about it, you are likely to be exposed to a lot of misinformation that overstates or dismisses the capability of AI.
